# Incident Management & Troubleshooting

## Intro

The incident management steps to have in mind when being on-call and getting an alert are:

1. Verify the issue
2. Triage
3. Communicate and escalate if needed
4. Mitigate
5. Troubleshoot
6. Postmortem

## Troubleshooting

As general troubleshooting or debugging techniques:

- Do not make things worse (e.g., avoid random changes).
- Communicate with the team and take notes.
- Use chat mediums for communication and timeline tracking.
- Divide the problem space.
- Change one thing at a time.
- Test known solutions but address recurrent issues.
- Perform quick tests early for relevant information.
- If initial tests fail, step back and restart systematically, validating assumptions with others.
